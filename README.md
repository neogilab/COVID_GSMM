Multiomics personalized network analyses highlight progressive immune disruption of central metabolism associated with COVID-19 severity

The system-wide metabolomics profile in COVID-19 patients identified several biomarkers that shed mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with gender, age, ethnicity, and co-morbidities. In this study, we used system-wide network-based system biology analysis using whole blood RNA-seq, immune-phenotyping by flow cytometry, plasma metabolomics, and single cell-type metabolomics (sctMetabolomics) to identify the metabo-transcriptomics mechanism of COVID-19 severity. Digital cell quantification and immune-phenotyping of the mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) indicated a substantial role in coordinating the immune cells that mediate the COVID-19 disease severity. Stratum-specific and personalized genome-scale metabolic modeling further indicated that transporter genes such as SLC16A6 and SLC29A1, expressed by monocytes, and metabolites such as Î±-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate, and butyrate, play a crucial role in COVID-19 severity. Monocyte sctMetabolomics identified increased a-ketoglutarate, malate, and citrate in COVID-19 patients. Finally, the group- and personalized-level re-arrangement of central carbon and energy metabolism points towards potential targetable elements for COVID-19 treatment depending on disease severity
